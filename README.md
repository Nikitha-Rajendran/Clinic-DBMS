# Clinic-DBMS
The Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act of 2010 mandates that all clinics and polyclinics with dispensaries digitize their records. This can be a significant financial burden for small-scale clinics such as my father's. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I was inspired to explore solutions to this problem. My initial idea was to gather and standardize clinic data on the cloud and then create a database to connect different data points. This would help test my understanding of database design and identify areas for further learning.

I believed that a cloud-based database could be a viable option for small-scale clinics, offering a cost-effective and scalable way to store and manage patient data. The first step would be to gather data from various sources, including paper records and electronic systems, and standardize it into a consistent format. This would enable efficient data analysis and integration.

A well-designed database could then be used to connect different data points, such as patient information, appointment details, prescriptions, and medication records. This would allow for more comprehensive analysis and insights into patient care. By creating a centralized repository of data, clinics could improve their operations, enhance patient care, and comply with regulatory requirements.

To test my understanding of database design and identify potential challenges, I planned to develop a simple database model. This would involve defining entities (such as patients, appointments, and medications), establishing relationships between them, and ensuring data integrity. By building a basic database structure, I could gain valuable experience and identify areas for further learning.

Overall, the goal was to create a solution that would help small-scale clinics overcome the financial and technical hurdles associated with digitization. A cloud-based database could provide a practical and affordable way to store, manage, and analyze patient data, ultimately improving the quality of care and efficiency of operations.
